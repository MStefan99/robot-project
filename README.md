Made for one of college courses, this project is a firmware for PSoC-based robot that allows it to perform various tasks like sumo battle, line following and pathfinding.

## Tasks included in the project
1. Sumo battle - two robots are placed inside a circle. The team whose robot manages to stay in the circle for longer wins.  
2. Line following - two robots are placed at the start of the identical lines. The robots must then use their reflectance sensors to reach the end first.  
3. Path finding - the robot is given a simple maze. The robot then must use its reflectance and distance sensors to find its way out through a simple maze.
